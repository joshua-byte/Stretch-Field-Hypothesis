# Stretch Field Hypothesis: Empirical Fitting Code

This repository contains Python code for testing the **Stretch Field Hypothesis (SFH)** using Type Ia supernova distance data. The SFH is a conceptual framework that interprets spacetime dynamics as emerging from **informational stretch** and **structural tension**, rather than purely geometric curvature. This project integrates empirical fitting with philosophical interpretation, providing both numerical results and conceptual insight.
